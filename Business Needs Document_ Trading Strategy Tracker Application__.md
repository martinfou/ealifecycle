## **Business Needs Document: Trading Strategy Tracker Application**

**1\. Introduction**  
This document outlines the business needs and requirements for a web-based application designed to empower individual traders to effectively track, manage, and analyze their trading strategies. The application aims to centralize strategy information, monitor their performance across different statuses, and facilitate the import of historical trading data for analysis. This will lead to improved decision-making, better strategy evaluation, and ultimately, potentially enhanced trading outcomes.  
**2\. Business Problem/Opportunity**  
Currently, the process of tracking trading strategies and their performance is often fragmented and manual. Traders may rely on spreadsheets, notes, or the memory of their trading platform. This lack of a centralized system leads to several challenges:

* **Difficulty in Monitoring Strategy Status:** It's challenging to keep track of which strategies are in the testing phase (demo), live trading (production), temporarily paused (on hold), or no longer in use (retired). This lack of clear status can lead to confusion and inefficient resource allocation.  
* **Lack of Structured Strategy Information:** Key details about each strategy, such as its name, traded symbols, timeframe, and specific identifiers (magic numbers), are not consistently recorded or easily accessible.  
* **Inefficient Timeframe Management:** Manually selecting and remembering the timeframe for each strategy can be error-prone. A standardized, controlled list of timeframes is needed.  
* **Absence of Historical Status Tracking:** Understanding when and why a strategy's status changed over time is crucial for evaluating its lifecycle and the effectiveness of adjustments. This historical data is often lost in manual tracking.  
* **Tedious Performance Data Integration:** Manually compiling and analyzing trading history from platforms like FX Blue is time-consuming and prone to errors. A streamlined import process is required to gain insights into strategy performance.  
* **Security and Access Control Concerns:** For traders who may collaborate or want to ensure the privacy of their strategies, a system with user accounts and access controls is essential.

This application presents an opportunity to address these challenges by providing a dedicated, organized, and secure platform for managing trading strategies.  
**3\. Business Needs**  
The proposed Trading Strategy Tracker application must fulfill the following business needs for the user (the individual trader):

* **Centralized Strategy Management:** The user needs a single platform to record and manage all their trading strategies and their associated details.  
* **Clear Visibility of Strategy Status:** The user needs to easily see the current status of each strategy (Demo, Production, On Hold, Retired) to understand their active and inactive strategies.  
* **Standardized Timeframe Selection:** The user needs a consistent and controlled way to assign a specific trading timeframe to each strategy, ensuring accuracy and uniformity.  
* **Efficient Strategy Identification:** The user needs to be able to uniquely identify their strategies through editable names and, optionally, magic numbers used in their trading platforms.  
* **Tracking of Traded Instruments:** The user needs to record the specific financial instruments (symbols) traded by each strategy for better organization and analysis.  
* **Historical Status Monitoring:** The user needs to track the history of status changes for each strategy, including the dates and the reasons (implicitly through the status change itself), to understand the strategy's evolution.  
* **Streamlined Performance Data Integration:** The user needs a simple and efficient way to import their historical trading data from FX Blue to analyze the performance of their strategies.  
* **Secure Access and Data Protection:** The user needs a secure environment with user accounts and password protection to safeguard their sensitive trading strategy information.  
* **Role-Based Access Control (for potential future collaboration or multi-user scenarios):** The system should support user groups with different levels of access to manage strategies and application settings.

**4\. System Goals and Objectives**  
The primary goals of the Trading Strategy Tracker application are to:

* **Improve Organization:** Provide a structured and centralized system for managing trading strategies and related information.  
* **Enhance Monitoring:** Offer clear visibility into the current status and historical progression of each trading strategy.  
* **Simplify Data Integration:** Streamline the process of importing and associating historical trading data with specific strategies.  
* **Increase Efficiency:** Reduce the time and effort required to track and analyze trading strategies compared to manual methods.  
* **Ensure Data Integrity:** Provide a reliable and secure platform for storing and managing sensitive trading information.  
* **Facilitate Analysis (Future):** Lay the groundwork for future features that will enable users to analyze the performance of their strategies based on imported data.

**5\. Functional Requirements**  
The system must provide the following functionalities:

* **User Authentication:** Secure login and logout functionality with username/password.  
* **User and Group Management (Admin Area):**  
  * Ability to create, edit, and delete user accounts.  
  * Ability to create, edit, and delete user groups (e.g., Administrators, Users).  
  * Ability to assign users to specific groups.  
* **Strategy Management:**  
  * Ability to create new trading strategies with fields for:  
    * Editable Strategy Name.  
    * Symbols Traded (free-text input).  
    * Timeframe (dropdown menu driven by the timeframes table).  
    * Magic Number (optional numeric field).  
    * Initial Status (dropdown menu driven by the statuses table). Upon creation, the corresponding "date in status" field should be automatically populated with the current date.  
  * Ability to view a list of all strategies with their key details (name, current status, symbols, timeframe).  
  * Ability to edit existing strategies (name, symbols, magic number).  
  * Ability to change the status of a strategy through a user-friendly interface (e.g., dropdown or buttons). Upon status change:  
    * Update the status in the strategies table.  
    * Update the corresponding "date in status" field with the current date.  
    * Record the status change in the status\_history table, including the previous status, new status, timestamp, and the user who made the change.  
  * Ability to view the status history for a specific strategy, showing the previous status, new status, and the date/time of the change.  
* **Table-Driven Data Management (Admin Area):**  
  * **Statuses:** Ability to manage the list of available strategy statuses (add, edit, delete).  
  * **Timeframes:** Ability to manage the list of available trading timeframes (add, edit, delete). This list will populate the dropdown menu when creating or editing strategies.  
* **FX Blue Trade History Import:**  
  * Ability to upload an FX Blue trade history file (likely CSV or potentially other formats).  
  * Functionality to parse the uploaded file and extract relevant trade data.  
  * Mechanism to associate the imported trades with specific strategies (ideally based on magic number if available, with potential for manual association).  
  * Storage of imported trade data in a dedicated trades table.  
* **Security:**  
  * Secure user authentication with password hashing.  
  * Authorization based on user groups to restrict access to certain features and data (e.g., administrative functions).  
  * Protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
