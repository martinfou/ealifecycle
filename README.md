- **`app/Http/Controllers/StrategyController.php`** - EA management logic
- **`resources/views/strategies/`** - EA management pages
- **`database/migrations/`** - Database structure changes

### Development Workflow

**üîÑ Daily Development**
```bash
# Start development server
php artisan serve

# In another terminal, watch for asset changes
npm run dev

# Run migrations when database changes
php artisan migrate

# Build assets before running tests
npm run build

# Run tests
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

**üìä Working with Data**
```bash
# Reset database with fresh data
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed

# Create a new migration
php artisan make:migration add_new_field_to_strategies

# Create a new model
php artisan make:model NewModel -m
```

### Common Development Tasks

#### Adding a New EA Status
1. **Add to database**: Create migration in `database/migrations/`
2. **Update seeder**: Add to `database/seeders/StatusSeeder.php`
3. **Update views**: Add color/styling in blade templates

#### Creating a New Page
1. **Add route**: In `routes/web.php`
2. **Create controller method**: In appropriate controller
3. **Create view**: In `resources/views/`
4. **Add navigation**: In `resources/views/layouts/navigation.blade.php`

#### Working with User Permissions
```php
// Check if user can edit a strategy
if ($user->canEdit($strategy)) {
    // Allow editing
}

// Get strategies user can access
$strategies = $user->accessibleStrategies();
```

### Development Setup

To get started with development, follow these steps after cloning the repository:

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    composer install
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Activate Git Hooks**:
    To ensure code quality and prevent common errors, we use shared Git hooks. Activate them by running:
    ```bash
    git config core.hooksPath .githooks
    ```
    This will enable automated checks before you commit.

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**‚ùå "Class 'PDO' not found"**
```bash
# Install PHP PDO extension
# Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt-get install php8.4-pdo php8.4-sqlite3

# macOS with Homebrew:
brew install php@8.4
```

**‚ùå "Permission denied" on storage folder**
```bash
# Fix Laravel permissions
chmod -R 775 storage
chmod -R 775 bootstrap/cache
```

**‚ùå "Vite manifest not found"**
```bash
# Build the assets
npm run build

# Or for development
npm run dev
```

**‚ùå "Database does not exist"**
```bash
# Create SQLite database file
touch database/database.sqlite

# Run migrations
php artisan migrate
```

**‚ùå "Node.js version too old"**
```bash
# Update Node.js to latest LTS version
# Then reinstall dependencies
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Performance Issues
```bash
# Clear all caches
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan view:clear

# Optimize for production
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
```

## Security Vulnerabilities

Please review our [security policy](../../security/policy) on how to report security vulnerabilities.

## üß™ Running Tests

Before running tests locally, make sure you have built the frontend assets so that the Vite manifest exists:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

The GitHub Actions workflow now automatically installs Node.js dependencies and builds assets before running PHPUnit tests, so this error should not occur in CI/CD.

# Trading Strategy Tracker

## Features

- **Strategy Management**: Create, edit, and view trading strategies with fields for name, symbols, timeframes, magic number, group, and description.
- **Source Code Upload**: Upload a single source code file per strategy. Download and view the file in a modal with syntax highlighting. Delete or replace the file from the edit page.
- **Backtest Report Upload**: Upload a single PDF backtest report per strategy. Download the report or view it in a modal. Replace or delete the report from the edit page.
- **File Management UX**:
  - On the **show page**: Both source code and backtest report fields display the filename as a blue download link, with a green "View" link for modal viewing. Only one file of each type is allowed per strategy.
  - On the **edit page**: Both fields show the current file (if any) with green "View" and red "Delete" links. Uploading a new file replaces the old one. Deleting removes the file from the strategy.
- **Permissions**: Only users with access to a strategy can upload, view, or delete files.
- **CI/CD**: Asset build and cache clear steps are required for tests and deployment. See below.

## Setup & Development

- Run `php artisan migrate` to set up the database.
- Run `php artisan storage:link` to enable public file access.
- Build frontend assets with `npm install && npm run build` before running tests or deploying.
- Clear caches with `php artisan optimize:clear && php artisan cache:clear && php artisan config:clear && php artisan route:clear && php artisan view:clear` after code or view changes.

## File Storage

- Source code files are stored in `storage/app/public/strategy_source_codes`.
- Backtest reports are stored in `storage/app/public/reports`.
- Only one file of each type is allowed per strategy. Uploading a new file replaces the old one.

## UI/UX

- **Show Page**: Download and view links for both files. No delete option for backtest report.
- **Edit Page**: Download, view, and delete links for both files. Uploading a new file replaces the old one.
- **Modals**: In-page modal viewers for both PDF and source code files, with resizable and fullscreen options.

## UI/UX Improvements

- The close (X) button in all file view modals (PDF and source code) now has extra padding and is positioned further from the top and right borders. This ensures the button is not too close to the edge, providing a more polished and accessible appearance on all devices.

## Contribution

- Please use feature branches and submit pull requests for review.
- Keep documentation and UI consistent with the latest features.

## Strategy File Management (Source Code & Backtest Reports)

- On the **edit strategy** page, you can upload, view, download, or delete both the source code file and the backtest report (PDF).
- If a file is present, its info, download, and view links are shown, along with a red delete button.
- **Deleting a file** (source code or report):
  - Works instantly via AJAX‚Äîno confirmation popup.
  - Only the file info and delete button are removed from the page; the upload field remains visible so you can immediately upload a new file.
  - A green toast notification confirms successful deletion.
  - The file is deleted from both the database and the file system.
- On the **show strategy** page, you can view and download files, but not delete them.
- All modals for viewing files are resizable and modern.
