# Development Workflow Configuration

## Git Workflow Preferences

### Branching Strategy
- **Never commit directly to main**
- Create feature branches for all changes
- Branch naming convention: `feature/short-description` or `fix/issue-description`
- Always branch from latest main

### Deployment Process
- Main branch auto-deploys to production
- Feature branches should be merged via Pull Request
- Test changes on feature branch before merging

### Branch Examples
- `feature/add-trading-symbols`
- `feature/update-dashboard-styling`
- `fix/timeframe-validation-issue`
- `feature/user-permissions-system`

### Commands Preference
```bash
# Start new feature
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/description-here

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"
git push origin feature/description-here

# Then create PR for review and merge
```
